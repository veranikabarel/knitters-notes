# Buttons

## Usage

Buttons are used to trigger internal actions within your web applications.

## Text Buttons

Text buttons are simply text labels.

## Contained Buttons

Outline buttons are generally used to indicate a secondary task. These tasks are still considered important but are not as important as the primary action on the page.

## Outlined Buttons

This type of button is usually reserved for the most important action on a page. This typically means you will only see one of this type of button per screen.
